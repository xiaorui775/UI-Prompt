## 🧭 Project Purpose

Many people directly generate websites using AI (such as Claude Code, Codex, Augment, etc.), and the results often have a strong "AI style". This project aims to solve this pain point: we provide well-designed and battle-tested Prompt templates that you can paste into any AI to quickly generate cleaner, more usable, and consistent UIs.

- Problem: AI-generated UIs tend to be similar and lack design language.
- Solution: Drive stable "AI → UI" output through "Style Cards + Bilingual Prompt Templates + One-Click Copy + Instant Preview".
- Goal: Help you quickly build high-quality UIs, reduce the "AI look", and maintain style controllability and maintainability.
